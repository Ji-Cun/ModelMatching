# Automatic Component Identification Based on Time Series Classification for Intelligent Devices

**The repository is for a paper on this topic under review.**

With the development of manufacturing technology, multi-functional devices can replace some components anywhere to meet the needs of different functions. When replacing device components, workers usually do not inform the remote servers. This will lead to the mismatch between the device components and their data models in the severs. To address this problem, a fusion method for automatic component identification is proposed in this study. Firstly, we converted the component identification problem to time series classification problem. Following by, some classifiers are trained based on the generated time series data of models. Then, the classifiers are used to matching the collected data to component models. Finally, we identify the component through fusion decision. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has high component identification accuracy.
